One of the main parts of GraphTea is the graph editing part, this is a
very complicated part, and one of the most things in this part is mapping
actions with event, so the user interacting with this part directly and
it should be as user-friendly as possible,

there are several different ways to do this, and i decide this way after
working with several diagram editing programs:

implementing such a dirty event map to action, maked the code a bit dirty,...


SelectVertex:
    Click on vertex,
    pressing Control key means continious selection , (dont clear older selection)

Select Edge:
    like select vertex.

Rectangular Selection:
    this means selecting allthings in a rectangular region of graph.
    dragging mouse on graph and dropping it,
    Control key for continious selection

Add Edge:
    drag mouse from one vertex to another,
    the first vertex should not be selected (see move vertex)

Add Vertex:
    Click on the graph (in GraphTea it is GraphSelectPoint)
    the selection should be empty (see clear selection)

Clear Selection:
    Click on the graph.

Delete Selected:
    pressing Delete key deletes selected things.

Resize Vertex:
    every selected vertex can be resized.
    resizing a vertex, causes to resize other selected verteices by the same values

Move Vertex:
    see move selected.

Move Selected:
    dragging mouse on a vertex.
    the vertex should be selected (see add edge)

Select All:
    pressing Control+A key on keyboard.
