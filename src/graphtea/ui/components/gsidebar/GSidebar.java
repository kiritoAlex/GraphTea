/**
 * java currently (now we have jdk 1.5) does not supports "Vertical Text"
 * yes, yes, i know that it's a shame for java.
 * i searched the internet for some hours to find that how can i write a String vertically in any way on the screen
 * you know that the side bar buttons are vertically, and the texts in JButtons is aligned vertically
 * I suggested some ways for doing this.
 * 1- the texts in the swing can be HTML, i mean that you can write for ex. b.setText("<html><font color="red">asda</font></html>");
 * we used this method in hour vertices to color out texts.
 * so if we have the ability of writing text vertically in HTML, then we can use this to have the vertical buttons,
 * i had sawn vertical texts, in some pages using Internet Explorer. but when i search for such a future , it seems
 * that this feature is not a standard HTML feature, and just supported by IE.
 * 2- we can build a system from base, like the current system. current system write horizontally, and we can build our
 * system writing vertically, independent of the old system.
 * this way is hard to implement. it needs a great amount of work to support all the features of such a system.
 * when i was searching the internet for finding a solution, i find a project for writing the texts vertically , and
 * it used the way i said above, and also it was free!
 * but i didn't like to use the system in GraphTea project. because i think that it adds too complexity to GraphTea
 * and also i think that the one that should do the jub is SUN. so i think that it is better that wait until the sun
 * implement this feature, and i preferred a third solution.
 * 3- our slide bar button will not more than 10. so simply we can just take a picture from input and display it
 * , so the user can put every thing on the picture including vertical texts.
 * 4- and there is another way , that i think it is a hack!
 * we can write the texts horizontally , then take a picture of it, and then simply rotate the text. :D
 * but in graphtea i prefer to use the 3rd way because of its simplicity.
 * --------------
 * 5- roozbeh suggests a solution for the problem. he shows the Sun Java 2D demos, that are in the JDK Demos. there
 * was a demo of fonts in java2d. it seems that it can be very simple to rotate the texts in java2d.
