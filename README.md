# GraphTea
GraphTea is a software framework to work on graphs and social networks. 
It helps you to:
- draw a graph
- get reports about it
- run algorithms on it
- visualize it

[DOWNLOAD GraphTea](https://github.com/graphtheorysoftware/GraphTea/zipball/master)

it runs under window/linux/mac osx (based on java).


# YouTube demo
see this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gblxDCNsmY)

# RUN
execute `run.bat` (windows), or `run.sh` (linux/mac).

manually:
> java -jar graphtea-main.jar

# DEVELOP
for working on the source, 

1. make your changes
2. run make.sh (or type in terminal `./make.sh`)
3. it will compile your changes and run the application.


manually:

1. open terminal
2. `cd src/scripts`
3. `ant`. this will build the application for you in the binary folder.
4. for seeing your changes do the steps described for "run"

note that you should have [appache ant](http://ant.apache.org/) installed.

# Write a graph algorithm,
go change this file: [SampleAlgorithm.java](https://github.com/graphtheorysoftware/GraphTea/blob/master/src/graphtea/extensions/algorithms/SampleAlgorithm.java).
you can make also reports, generators, file formats and actions.

# What can you do with graphtea?

* Drawing your graph with a mouse or using predefined graphs (under graph > generate), like trees, complete graphs, stars, generalized peterson, etc.
* Getting information about your graphs (under graph > reports menu), like num of connected components, chromatic number, independence number, girth size, num of triangles etc.
* Run algorithms step by step on your graph and see how they work. This is very usefull for teaching graph algorithms. You can pause, and it shows the current state of algorithm by coloring edges and vertices.
* Visualizing your graphs. You made a social network from your database and want to represent it in a meaningfull way? Use the visualizations.
* Presenting your graphs in your papers, websites or reports. GraphTea has a wide range of options to draw graphs, having different colors for edges and vertices, different borders, fonts, sizes, etc. When you finish drawing your graph, you can save to an image file or even to a Tex document to put in your report.

* making new graph generators, graph reports, file types, actions, algorithms by writing extensions. Extensions provide a gateway to add new functionalities as simple as putting a file to extensions directory. You can write them using Java and Matlab. For more samples take a look at extensions directory.

# Need help?
more docs will come soon. if you have any questions just post it in the issues, and we will write you back as soon as possible.

# CONTRIBUTE
(http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/)
